## **Briefly About Myself:**
After completing my bachelor's degree, I worked as a teacher in various educational institutions for more than four years: school, college and university. There I taught history, social studies, fundamentals of philosophy, and was also a moderator of project groups. In parallel, I completed a master's degree in history.

From 2017 to 2021, I was the head of Alexei Navalny's [regional headquarters](https://shtab.navalny.com/hq/tver) in Tver. Then I worked as a journalist for a while.

It was interesting and important, but I always wanted to work in the commercial sector and see the results of my work faster. So I decided to start studying at RS School.

I know how to work in a team and unite very different people for a common cause. I have good leadership qualities and high ambitions. One of my defining qualities is a constant desire for development. I am sure that this will allow me to correct the lack of professional skills in development soon.
